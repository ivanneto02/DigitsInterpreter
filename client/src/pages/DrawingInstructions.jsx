                        Once you finish drawing the letter, you may press <b>"Next"</b> to move to the next letter.

                        Feel free to use any of these utilities to make the characters as close as possible to what you think the character should look like.
                        You may be asked to draw the same character at different times. This is intentional.


                        The second aspect (2) focuses on the userâ€™s experience of the application. Users need something tangible to connect with our application. By uploading their own images and having the application recognize the digits they have written, users have a use for the application besides data collection.
